# Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program

## Part 1: Responsive Web Design

### Project 1: Build a Portfolio Site

- This project is a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
- I've decided not to use any framework like Bootstrap so I can practice coding with plain HTML and CSS.
